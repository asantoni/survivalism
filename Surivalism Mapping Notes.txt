BEFORE WE BEGIN:
- Don't place monsters.
- Don't place loot.
- Monsters only despawn if they lose sight of you behind a wall. You need to break up your map into different areas or at least
  have some walls that block line of sight to keep it fun and have monsters near you always. (Hopefully with Zandro 2.0 this will change.)
- The maximum size of a map is a "big cube that goes from -9400 to +9400 on each axis". You will get glitchy collision detection
  and the monsters AI will bug out if you make a map that goes beyond those dimensions.

- The MAPINFO chunk must have an entry for your map, with ActivateOwnDeathSpecials. See MAPINFO inside doomz.pk3.

Respawn Points
- Place "Teleport Destination" actors where you want the player to be able to respawn, with tag 555.

Sector Tags
- Sectors with tag 0 will be considered "outside" and have their brightness change with the day/night cycle.


Monster Spawner
- Change modes by calling Script 226, with argument 1 set to:
   - 0 - Default monsters (zombie mix)
   - 1 - Imps
   - 2 - Swamp mudmen
   - 3 - Safe zone (no monsters)
   - 4 - Shadows
   - 5 - Forest zone
- To put different monster in different parts of your map, use a pair of linedefs to trigger Script 220. 
  Use action special 226 (Execute Always) to call script 220 when the player crosses each line, with Argument 1 set to whatever 
  mode you want. (Look at the doomz2 map if this isn't clear, and feel free to copy/paste the linedefs from there.)
- Tip: If you don't want monsters to spawn on the other side of a canyon, drop the sky ceiling a bit
  in the middle. This will cause the monster spawner projectiles to bounce off it and not cross the canyon.


Mines:
- Place a MineManager thing in the middle of your mine. It will populate your mine with rocks within a radius of 640 map units
  and refresh them every 5 minutes.
- You don't have to make your mine narrow, it can be an open space.

Quests:
- TID 6000
- TID 6001
