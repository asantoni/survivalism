-- Death Incarnate --
* Updated included Hades Sphere's behavior.  See below.

* Added editor tags to DECORATE.
* Replaced NULL with TNT1.

-- Hades Sphere --
* Fixed selfdestruct behavior for proper kill tracking and to prevent "failure" of selfdestruct.
* Fixed "chase" behavior so it won't misbehave when spawned via "A_PainAttack" or "A_DualPainAttack."
* Monster no longer attempts to selfdestruct while in teleport sequence.
* Removed "HSBoom" actor and transferred selfdestruct properties to a parameterized "A_Explode".
* Increased bounding box size to better match sprite size.
* Added a modified icedeath state, so frozen corpses would not float indefinitely.
* Converted sprites to PNG and audio to OGG.
* Included GLDefs (copied from Death Incarnate submission).
