## Developing

1. Clone the [survivalism-tools](https://www.github.com/asantoni/survivalism-tools) repository beside your clone of this repository. For convenience, it includes all the binaries needed to compile this WAD.

2. Install [Zandronum](http://www.zandronum.com) and [grab a copy of doom2.wad](http://store.steampowered.com/app/2300/). 

3. On Windows, open a command prompt to the survivalism directory and run:

        make
    
    To compile and play it all at once, run:

        play
        

## Mapping

Please see the [Survivalism Mapping Notes](Surivalism%20Mapping%20Notes.txt) document. I recommend any recent build of [GZDoom Builder](http://devbuilds.drdteam.org/doombuilder2-gzdb/) as an editor. If you're new to Doom mapping, there's some quick [video tutorials on the Doom Builder website](http://doombuilder.com/index.php?p=tutorials) to help get you started.
